INCENSE
browse

columns should be sortable v^
ability to drill down into each cell to reach a search by the cell (search by stats, by name, by brand, by country) starting with info on the one selected
(for example, if I click on the brand "hermann-dicki", i expect to be brough to a page with all the items by hermann-dicki, same for the country

is it possible to have the statistics wheel start at 1 instead of 0? visually it will make more sense to the reader

ability to click on each dimension of the statistics wheel to bring up a definition of the profile (maybe just in a hover tooltip) and clicking brings to a list of other incenses with a similar rating

nice to have: stats from the company on one side, stats from the user on the other (avg reported burn time & avg reported price paid vs whats on the official website)

more detailed description questions that may help guide reviews (such as prompting perceived quality, smoke amount, best for which occasion, etc). the wheel graph may also be difficult for some users to user, there should also be an option to type in the number ratings themselves

clickable user profiles

trusted reviews (up or down badges for reviews so other users can vet)

BRANDS

needs search box
Needs sortable columns
ability to search by country
show a rating overall based on ones that havent been rated yet
